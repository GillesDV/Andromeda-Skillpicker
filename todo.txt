3 parts in the mainpage -> 3 subfolders in Components folder

possibly remove -Component suffix

Add a DropDown, near the search, allowing you to order it by: Name, class, base shield, base health, ...

V1.0:
Must be able to :
- select a character
- pick Skills
- select weapon
- see what changes those choices have on the total stats of that character


V1.2:
- Add decent avatars
- Bonus stat for characters, either with text or symbols (+ text on hover)
- Add primers/detonators to skills
-- maybe add an extra attribute per skill in the dataObject? isPrimer & isDetonator
- Option to share builds via URL
- Option to assign role to a build? Mook, hybrid, ...
- Select a level for weapons


V1.Never
- Option to rate builds
-- Would require a back-end. More than just front-end. Outside scope atm.
